Permanent Income Model using the DLE class
==========================================

This notebook adds a third solution method for the
linear-quadratic-Gaussian permanent income model with
:math:`\beta R = 1`, complementing the other two solution methods shown
in `this
notebook <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.notebooks/blob/master/permanent_income.ipynb>`__.

The new solution method uses the **DLE** class, which maps the permanent
income model into the framework of Hansen & Sargent (2013) "Recursive
Models of Dynamic Linear Economies".

.. code:: ipython3

    import quantecon as qe
    import numpy as np
    import scipy.linalg as la
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from quantecon import DLE
    
    %matplotlib inline
    np.set_printoptions(suppress=True, precision=4)

The permanent income model
--------------------------

The LQ permanent income model is an example of a **savings problem**

A consumer has preferences over consumption streams that are ordered by
the utility functional

.. math::  E_0 \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t u(c_t),  \quad(1) 

where :math:`E_t` is the mathematical expectation conditioned on the
consumer's time :math:`t` information, :math:`c_t` is time :math:`t`
consumption, :math:`u(c)` is a strictly concave one-period utility
function, and :math:`\beta \in (0,1)` is a discount factor.

The LQ model gets its name partly from assuming that the utility
function :math:`u` is quadratic:

.. math::  u(c) = -.5(c - \gamma)^2 

where :math:`\gamma>0` is a bliss level of consumption.

The consumer maximizes the utility functional (1) by choosing a
consumption, borrowing plan :math:`\{c_t, b_{t+1}\}_{t=0}^\infty`
subject to the sequence of budget constraints

.. math::  c_t + b_t = R^{-1} b_{t+1}  + y_t, t \geq 0,  \quad(2)  

where :math:`y_t` is an exogenous stationary endowment process,
:math:`R` is a constant gross risk-free interest rate, :math:`b_t` is
one-period risk-free debt maturing at :math:`t`, and :math:`b_0` is a
given initial condition.

We shall assume that :math:`R^{-1} = \beta`.

Equation (2) is linear.

We use another set of linear equations to model the endowment process.

In particular, we assume that the endowment process has the state-space
representation

.. math::

    \eqalign{ z_{t+1} & = A_{22} z_t + C_2 w_{t+1}  \cr
                  y_t & = U_y  z_t  \cr} \quad (3) 

where :math:`w_{t+1}` is an i.i.d. process with mean zero and identity
contemporaneous covariance matrix, :math:`A_{22}` is a stable matrix,
its eigenvalues being strictly below unity in modulus, and :math:`U_y`
is a selection vector that identifies :math:`y` with a particular linear
combination of the :math:`z_t`.

We impose the following condition on the consumption, borrowing plan:

.. math::  E_0 \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t b_t^2 < +\infty. \quad (4) 

This condition suffices to rule out Ponzi schemes.

(We impose this condition to rule out a borrow-more-and-more plan that
would allow the household to enjoy bliss consumption forever.)

The state vector confronting the household at :math:`t` is

.. math::  x_t = \left[\matrix{z_t \cr b_t\cr}\right],

where :math:`b_t` is its one-period debt falling due at the beginning of
period :math:`t` and :math:`z_t` contains all variables useful for
forecasting its future endowment.

We assume that :math:`\{y_t\}` follows a second order univariate
autoregressive process:

.. math::  y_{t+1} = \alpha + \rho_1 y_t + \rho_2 y_{t-1} + \sigma w_{t+1} 

Solution with the DLE class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One way of solving this model is to map the problem into the framework
outlined in Section 4.8 of HS2013 by setting up our technology,
information and preference matrices as follows:

**Technology:**
:math:`\phi_c=  \left[ {\begin{array}{c}  1 \\ 0  \end{array} }  \right]`
,
:math:`\phi_g=  \left[ {\begin{array}{c}  0 \\ 1  \end{array} }  \right]`
,
:math:`\phi_i=  \left[ {\begin{array}{c}  -1 \\ -0.00001  \end{array} }  \right]`,
:math:`\Gamma=  \left[ {\begin{array}{c}  -1 \\ 0  \end{array} }  \right]`,
:math:`\Delta_k = 0`, Â :math:`\Theta_k = R`

**Information:**
:math:`A_{22} = \left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}  1 & 0 & 0 \\ \alpha & \rho_1 & \rho_2 \\ 0 & 1 & 0  \end{array} }  \right]`,
:math:`C_{2} = \left[ {\begin{array}{c}  0 \\ \sigma \\ 0  \end{array} }  \right]`,
:math:`U_b = \left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}  \gamma & 0 & 0  \end{array} }  \right]`,
:math:`U_d = \left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}  0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0  \end{array} }  \right]`

**Preferences:** :math:`\Lambda = 0`, :math:`\Pi = 1`,
:math:`\Delta_h = 0`, :math:`\Theta_h = 0`

We set parameters

:math:`\alpha = 10, \beta = 0.95, \rho_1 = 0.9, \rho_2 = 0, \sigma = 1`

(The value of :math:`\gamma` does not affect the optimal decision rule.)

The chosen matrices mean that the household's technology is:

.. math::  c_t + k_{t-1} = i_t + y_t

.. math:: \frac{k_t}{R} = i_t

.. math::  l_t^2 = (0.00001)^2i_t 

Combining the first two of these gives the budget constraint of the
permanent income model, where :math:`k_t = b_{t+1}`.

The third equation is a very small penalty on debt-accumulation to rule
out Ponzi schemes.

We set up this instance of the DLE class below:

.. code:: ipython3

    alpha, beta, rho1, rho2, sigma = 10, 0.95, 0.9, 0, 1
    
    gamma = np.array([[-1],[0]])
    phic = np.array([[1],[0]])
    phig = np.array([[0],[1]])
    phi1 = 1e-5
    phii = np.array([[-1],[-phi1]])
    deltak = np.array([[0]])
    thetak = np.array([[1/beta]])
    beta = np.array([[beta]])
    llambda = np.array([[0]])
    pih = np.array([[1]])
    deltah = np.array([[0]])
    thetah = np.array([[0]])
    
    a22 = np.array([[1,0,0],[alpha,rho1,rho2],[0,1,0]])
    c2 = np.array([[0],[sigma],[0]])
    ud = np.array([[0,1,0],[0,0,0]])
    ub = np.array([[100,0,0]])
    
    x0 = np.array([[0],[0],[1],[0],[0]])
    
    Info1 = (a22,c2,ub,ud)
    Tech1 = (phic,phig,phii,gamma,deltak,thetak)
    Pref1 = (beta,llambda,pih,deltah,thetah)
    
    Econ1 = DLE(Info1, Tech1, Pref1)

To check the solution of this model with that from the **LQ** problem,
we select the :math:`S_c` matrix from the DLE class. The solution to the
DLE economy has:

.. math:: c_t = S_c x_t

.. code:: ipython3

    Econ1.Sc




.. parsed-literal::

    array([[ 0.    , -0.05  , 65.5172,  0.3448,  0.    ]])



The state vector in the DLE class is:

.. math::


     x_t = \left[ {\begin{array}{c}
      h_{t-1} \\ k_{t-1} \\ z_t
      \end{array} }
      \right]

where :math:`k_{t-1}` = :math:`b_{t}` is set up to be :math:`b_t` in the
permanent income model.

The state vector in the LQ problem is
:math:`\left[\matrix{z_t \cr b_t\cr}\right]`.

Consequently, the relevant elements of Econ1.Sc are the same as in
:math:`-F` from the \*\* XXXX previous notebook\*\*

(see line 9 of **XXXX that notebook** for a print out of the :math:`-F`
matrix)

The plot below quickly replicates the first two figures of \*\* XXXX
that notebook\*\* to confirm that the solutions are the same.

.. code:: ipython3

    plt.figure(figsize=(16,5))
    plt.subplot(121)
    
    for i in range(25):
        Econ1.compute_sequence(x0,ts_length = 150)
        plt.plot(Econ1.c[0],color='g')
        plt.plot(Econ1.d[0],color='b')
    plt.plot(Econ1.c[0],label='Consumption',color='g')
    plt.plot(Econ1.d[0],label='Income',color='b')
    plt.legend(loc='best')
    
    plt.subplot(122)
    
    for i in range(25):
        Econ1.compute_sequence(x0,ts_length = 150)
        plt.plot(Econ1.k[0],color='r')
    plt.plot(Econ1.k[0],label='Debt',color='r')
    plt.legend(loc='best');
